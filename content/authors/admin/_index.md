Natalie Plank is a Senior Lecturer in Physics at Victoria University of Wellington and a Principal Investigator of the MacDiarmid Institute.  She runs the Nanomaterials Devices Group within the School of Chemical and Physical Sciences.  Here we are studying new ways of making electronic devices out of nanomaterials, including carbon nanotubes, metallic and semiconducting nanowires and organic conductors. Nanomaterials offer researchers a fascinating scope of properties to study in electronic devices. Due to the inherent size of the materials several areas of behaviour can be radically different from the bulk materials. As a consequence of this the global research effort in nanomaterials is huge and diverse.  

One of the key areas of excitement is in the field of nanomaterials for biosensors. Due to the enhanced surface to volume ratio of nanomaterials and their exceptional sensitivity to the surrounding environment it is possible to detect the presence of materials in the parts per billion range. We have been developing electronic platforms out of nanomaterials for biosensors using both aptamers and insect odorant receptors as the analyte detector unit.  Read on to find out more.
